This simple plugin calculate cliques of size k in the graph and lists them.\r\nThe algorithm is NP-Hard and it takes time for finding specific size cliques in the graph.\r\n# Algorithm\r\nFirstly, the algorithm removes nodes with degree lower than k-1 because these nodes can not take place iin making cliques of size k.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the algorithm uses a queue for finding cliques of size 1 and expanding it to 2, 3, ..., k\r\n\r\nMain reference of the algorithm is taken from Chapter 3, Section 3.1.1 of \"Community Detection and Mining in Social Media\" by  Lei Tang and Huan Liu:\r\nhttp://dmml.asu.edu/cdm/\r\n\r\n### GET The Source\r\n```\r\n$ cd mirsamantajbakhsh/CliqueDetector\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
